# ClimatronInterface

This is my attempt at creating an Interface to the Climatronic. 
The Climatronic (see other repository) is a quite simple HVAC controller. It handles the ventilation and some valves and can be used as a simple thermostat. 

This project is more a journey into how to use Python3 for this kind a projects as it contains experiments with Threading, modbus, mqtt and Object inheritance and other stuff.
Sharing the code might help you with your projects.
